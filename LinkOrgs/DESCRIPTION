Description: An R package for organizational records using the algorithms of Jerzak & Libgober  (2023+). The linkage is done based on organizational names and using half a billion open collaborated records on those names from LinkedIn users. It also contains functions implementing string matching performance metrics, as well as a fast, parallized version of fuzzy string matching.
