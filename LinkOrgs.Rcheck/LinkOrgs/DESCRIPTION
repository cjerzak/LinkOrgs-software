Description: An R package for organizational records using the algorithms of
    Jerzak & Libgober (2023+). The linkage is done based on organizational
    names and using half a billion open collaborated records on those names
    from LinkedIn users. It also contains functions implementing string
    matching performance metrics, as well as a fast, parallized version of
    fuzzy string matching.
